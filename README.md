# MAT-8542-Nonparametric-Statistics-Final-Project
For my graduate-level nonparametric statistics course at Villanova University, I compared parametric and nonparametric techniques to analyze FiveThirtyEight survey results pertaining to airplane etiquette.

The data were found here: https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/flying-etiquette-survey.

The R code contains an assortment of parametric and nonparametric tests on the survey results gathered by FiveThirtyEight. The results are summarized in the PowerPoint presentation, as well as the final written report.
